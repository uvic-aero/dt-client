# Desktop Client

The desktop client's purpose is to interface and visualize telemetry data obtained from
the microcontrollers onboard UAVs and UGVs

The desktop client is a React application built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is wrapped in an
[electron](https://electronjs.org/) app that allows the React app to be run in a desktop application.

This is the [tutorial that I used](https://flaviocopes.com/react-electron/) to set up this app.

## Requirements

-   `npm version 6.11.3` or higher
-   `node version v12.10.0` or higher
-   `git version 2.23.0` this is for husky, and lower versions may be acceptable.
    If your version of git is too old, you'll get an error when running `npm install`

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/uvic-aero/dt-client.git`
2. Set your current directory to `dt-client` with `cd dt-client`
3. Install node

-   OSX:
    -   run `brew update` followed by
    -   `brew install node`
-   Linux:
    -   `sudo apt update` followed by
    -   `sudo apt install nodejs` and finally,
    -   verify your version is up to date with `nodejs --version`

4. Install npm

-   OSX:
    -   `npm` should already be installed, so just verify the version with `npm --version`
-   Linux:
    -   `sudo apt install npm`
    -   verify your version is up to date with `npm --version`

5. Install dependencies for the react-electron application with `npm install`
6. Start the electron-react desktop app `npm start`
